# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
The purpose of this project is to analyze Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. Companies pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members. These members are then required to publish a review of the product. The goal is to determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members for the selected reviews. 

## We compared the following: 
* The number of reviews submitted: Vine = 12,228: Non-Vine = 1,617,533
* The number of 5 star reviews: Vine = 5,667: Non-Vine = 91,3077
* The percentage of 5 star reviews: Vine = 46%: Non-Vine = 56%

## We created a dataframe for paid and unpaid reviews to get the comparison details.

## Summary
Looking at this data, there does not appear to be any positive bias for paid reviews. In fact, there is a higher percentage of 5 star reviews submitted by unpaid members who are not part of the Vine program, showing that Vine members may be more likely to provide negative reviews.  For further analysis, one could consider looking at other categories to understand if these results are consistent.
